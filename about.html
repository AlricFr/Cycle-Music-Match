        <p>Who doesn't know it? You are training for a race, but you are on your own - no buddy to chase up the next climb. What do you do?
            Listen to music! But it got to be the right kind - Mozart won't get you that king of the mountain. 

            I was training for Traka 360 and figured I need the right kind of music. Knowing that there is research suggesting
            a better performance of athletes given the right musical stimulation, I wanted to match my planned ride with the the right kind
            of music. Spotify & Strava should deliver all the data.

            The project started as a Nights & Weekends project combining self taught programming & my passion of building great products. Let's
            see where this journey goes!
