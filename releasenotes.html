                After iterating locally & with some friends, the app is now available at <a href="www.pedalbeats.app">pedalbeats.app</a>. It is still
                limited to pre-registered users only, which is a requirement of the Spotify API. 

                Please sign up via the home page!

            <h2 class="release-title">Let's get the speed</h2>
            <p class="release-description">
               The main point of PedalBeats is to allow users creating playlists with specific tempos & energy levels.
               With this new release, users can now create playlists suitable for coffe rides (calm energy, slow tempo), climbs (medium energy & tempo)
               & flat rides (high energy & tempo). 

               The outcome can now be reviewed by users. Please let me know how you like the playlist at <a href="mailto:alric@pedalbeats.app">alric@pedalbeats.app</a>

            <h2 class="release-title">Custom Playlist creation</h2>
            <p class="release-description">
               Added a few parameters to the Playlist creation workflow. Users can now select the genre, a minimum length for
               the playlist and a name. The selected genre and the users personal taste enable the creation of the playlist which gets 
               saved to the users library.

            <p class="release-description">
                After learning the basics of HTML, CSS & JavaScript, I got used to Github and the Spotify API. 
                The initial implementation pulled in all available Genres with every run and therefore exceeded API limits. I overcame it
                by hard coding the most important ones. After that, a new playlist was possible to create in the users profile.
                Hard coded genre for now though ;)
